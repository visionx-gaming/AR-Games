### **ðŸŽ® AR Obstacle Escape - Gameplay Overview**
**Objective:**  
- The player must avoid falling obstacles by moving **left, right**, or **jumping**.  

**Game Mechanics:**  
- **Move Left/Right** by **tilting your head** left or right.  
- **Jump** when you physically **jump in real life** (detected by the camera).  
- **Obstacles fall from the top** and must be avoided:
  - If an **obstacle is on the left**, move right.  
  - If an **obstacle is on the right**, move left.  
  - If an **obstacle covers the whole screen**, **jump** to survive.  
- **Collision results in Game Over**, and the score resets.
